# **EncryptedMessaging – Secure Communications with Digital Identity and AES-256 Encryption**  

**EncryptedMessaging** is an innovative secure communication platform that integrates **AES-256 encryption** with a proprietary **digital identity system**, creating a new paradigm in protecting sensitive information in military and strategic contexts.  

## **Core Features**  
- **Unique digital identity** per device for signing data packets.  
- **End-to-end encryption** + **authenticity verification** (no man-in-the-middle risks).  
- **Serverless architecture** for high-criticality environments.  
- **Dynamic keys** regenerated per message.  
- **NATO-compliant** (STANAG, NATO Restricted).

## **Military-Grade Encryption: AES-256**  
- Approved by **NIST** and **NSA** for **Top Secret** data.  
- NATO-certifiable (e.g., STANAG 4774/4778).

## **Military Defense Applications**  
1. **Secure inter-unit communications**  
2. **Operational coordination** in hostile networks  
3. **Cyber-attack protection** (spoofing/MITM prevention)  
4. **Allied forces communication** (multinational ops)  
5. **Orders & intelligence transmission**  
6. **Remote control** of radars, turrets, drones  
7. **Autonomous systems programming** (missiles, robots)  
8. **Secure telemetry** from:  
   - Missile silos (pressure/temperature)  
   - Drones (GPS, status)  
   - Armored vehicles (position)  
   - Ships/aircraft (fuel, engine data)

## **NATO Compliance**  
✅ **STANAG alignment** (4774/4778, 4609)  
✅ **Interoperability** (TCP/IP, GSM, serial RS232/485)  
✅ **Secure key storage** (SecureStorage library)  
✅ **Open-source** for auditability (procurement-friendly)  

> *"Designed for NATO’s triple pillar: **Integrity, Authenticity, Confidentiality**."*

### Data exchange library between any type of device, usable for both desktop, mobile and internet of things applications:
* Support of digital signature on packages, and security level in military standard.
* This library, in terms of functionality and type of use, currently has no analogues.

### This library is suitable for:
* Encrypted communication to create applications similar to Telegram or Signal but with greater attention to computer security and privacy.
* Data transmission between device and cloud.
* Acquisition of telemetry data produced by equipment.
* Connecting the Internet of Things and wearable devices to the cloud.
* Protecting IoT devices from unauthorized access and attacks.
* Encrypting and protecting communications between IoT devices.
* Virtualize groups of devices, which interact with each other in an encrypted and independent manner.
* Making the communication network independent from static IPs
* Access devices that are protected by a firewall
* Assign digital identities to devices and accessories from the IoT
* Encrypted router for 5G technology
* And much more...

## The library works correctly under all kinds of circumstances and data lines, and is ready for production scenarios,

Our mission is to exacerbate the concept of security in messaging and create something conceptually new and innovative from a technical point of view. Top-level encrypted communication (there is no backend , there is no server-side contact list, there is no server but a simple router, the theory is that if the server does not exist then the server cannot be hacked, the communication is anonymous, the IDs are derived from a hash of the public keys, therefore in no case it is possible to trace who originates the messages, the encryption key is changed for each single message, and a system of digital signatures guarantees the origin of the messages and prevents attacks "men in the middle"). We use different concepts introduced with Bitcoin technology and the library itself: there are no accounts, the account is simply a pair of public and private keys, groups are also supported, the group ID is derived from a hash computed through the public keys of the members, since the hash process is irreversible, the level of anonymity is maximum). The publication of the source wants to demonstrate the genuineness of the concepts we have adopted! Thanks for your attention!
 
* [A robust cross-platform Cloud using this library as an underlying (Encrypted Clod)](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/CloudClient)

This project consists of three parts in the form of a library for security and functionality:

* [Secure storage](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/SecureStorage) it is a powerful data safe, the cryptographic keys and data that would allow the software to be attacked are kept with this tool.

* [Encrypted messaging](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging) it is a powerful low-level cryptographic protocol, of the Trustless type, which manages communication, groups and contacts (this software will never access your address book, this library is the heart of the application)

* [Communication channel](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging/tree/master/CommunicationChannel) is the low-level socket communication protocol underlying encrypted communication.

This project uses the Communication Channel project as its underlying, which creates a socket communication channel for transmitting and receiving encrypted data upstream from the library.
Communication Channel underlies the encrypted messaging protocol, we have separated the two parts because the idea is to provide an universal communication protocol, which can work on any type of communication medium and hardware. Communication Channel creates a tcp socket communication channel, but this underlying one can be replaced with an analogous communication channel working with GSM data networks (without using the internet), or with rs232, rs485 ports, or any other communication devices either digital and analog. Just change the underlying encrypted communication protocol and we can easily implement encrypted communication on any type of device and in any scenario. If necessary, we can create implementations of new communication channels on different hardware, on commission.

These libraries are also distributed as NuGet packages:

* [Secure storage (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SecureStorage/)

* [Encrypted messaging (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EncryptedMessaging/)

* [Communication channel (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunicationChannel/)
