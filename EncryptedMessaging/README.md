# **WHITE PAPER: STANG-V2 Candidate**  
*(Secure Tactical Adaptive Next-Generation Protocol - Version 2 Proposal)*  

---

### **Preamble: Redefining Secure Communications for Modern Warfare**  

In an era where quantum computing threatens legacy encryption and battlefield operations demand unprecedented coordination across distributed units, the **STANG-V2 candidate protocol** emerges as a transformative solution. This proposal presents a **quantum-resistant, multi-domain framework** designed to surpass existing NATO STANAG limitations while maintaining full interoperability with current systems.  

At its core, STANG-V2 introduces **Ephemeral Per-Message Key Encryption (EPMKE)** – a paradigm where each transmission is secured with a unique cryptographic key, dynamically generated and individually wrapped for every recipient using their public key. This approach, combined with **Group-Aware Key Distribution (GAKD)**, enables:  
- **Secure multicast communications** (e.g., simultaneous encrypted command dissemination to 100+ drones).  
- **Compartmentalized subgroup messaging** without key reuse vulnerabilities.  
- **Zero-trust metadata protection** through pseudonymous participant identifiers.  

Unlike traditional session-based encryption, STANG-V2’s **Key-Per-Message Architecture (KPMA)** ensures that even if a single key is compromised, only one message is affected – a critical advantage against advanced persistent threats.

### **1. Introduction: Addressing the Gaps in Current Standards**  

Existing NATO STANAG protocols (e.g., 4406, 5066) face three critical challenges in modern combat environments:  
1. **Quantum Vulnerability**: Reliance on ECDSA/RSA exposes communications to future Shor’s algorithm attacks.  
2. **Infrastructure Dependence**: Centralized servers create single points of failure.  
3. **Operational Rigidity**: IP-bound designs limit adaptability in EW-denied environments.  

The STANG-V2 candidate protocol addresses these limitations through:  

#### **1.1 Post-Quantum Hybrid Cryptography**  
- **Double-Layer Signatures**: ECDSA-521 + NTRU L5 signatures provide both NATO compliance (NSA Suite B) and quantum resistance.  
- **AES-256/GCM** for bulk encryption with **Key Derivation Ratcheting** – each message’s key is derived from the previous one but cannot be reversed.  

#### **1.2 Serverless Group Communications**  
- **Multi-Recipient Key Wrapping (MRKW)**: A single message payload is encrypted with:  
  ```math  
  E_{msg} = [E_{K_1}(AES_{key}), E_{K_2}(AES_{key}), ..., E_{K_n}(AES_{key})] + AES_{key}(Payload)  
  ```  
  Where \(K_1...K_n\) are recipients’ public keys.  
- **Dynamic Subgrouping**: Tactical units can be reorganized ad-hoc without rekeying (e.g., separating drone swarms into reconnaissance/attack clusters).

### **2. Technical Architecture**  

#### **2.1 Cryptographic Foundations**  
| Component               | STANG-V2 Candidate Solution         | NATO STANAG Equivalent |  
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|  
| **Encryption**          | AES-256-GCM + NTRU KEM              | AES-256 (STANAG 4546)  |  
| **Authentication**      | ECDSA-521 + NTRU Sign               | ECDSA (NSA Suite B)    |  
| **Key Distribution**    | MLS-inspired Key Packages           | Manual key rotation    |  

#### **2.2 Transport Layer Agnosticism**  
STANG-V2 operates over:  
- **Traditional IP networks** (backward-compatible with STANAG 5066).  
- **Non-IP channels** (tactical radios, laser comms, acoustic links).  
- **Disruption-tolerant networks** (store-and-forward via secure relays).  

**Case Study**: A submarine could receive encrypted orders via sonar, retransmit them to drones via LoRa, and confirm execution through a satellite laser link – all using the same cryptographic envelope.

### **3. Operational Advantages Over Legacy Systems**  

#### **3.1 Tactical Flexibility**  
- **Mission-Specific Key Hierarchies**:  
  ```python  
  # Example: Drone swarm command structure  
  group_key = derive_key("Recon-Alpha", master_key)  
  subgroup_keys = [derive_key(f"Unit-{i}", group_key) for i in range(10)]  
  ```  
- **1:N Secure Messaging**: 50% bandwidth reduction compared to STANAG 4406 multicast.  

#### **3.2 Security Enhancements**  
- **Forward Secrecy++**: Keys are not just ephemeral but also **unlinkable** between messages.  
- **Signature Chaining**: Each message includes a hash of the previous one to prevent timeline manipulation.  

---

### **4. NATO Integration Pathway**  

#### **4.1 Compliance Strategy**  
- **Phase 1 (Validation)**:  
  - Certify NTRU L5 under **STANAG 4778 Annex Q**.  
  - Test interoperability with **Harris Falcon IV** radios.  
- **Phase 2 (Adoption)**:  
  - Integrate into **Federated Mission Networking (FMN)**.  
  - Develop **Tactical Reference Implementation** for NATO CIS.  

#### **4.2 Backward Compatibility**  
STANG-V2 supports:  
- **Legacy Mode**: AES-256-only for older systems.  
- **Transitional Mode**: Hybrid ECDSA+NTRU signatures.

### Data exchange library between any type of device, usable for both desktop, mobile and internet of things applications:
* Support of digital signature on packages, and security level in military standard.
* This library, in terms of functionality and type of use, currently has no analogues.

### This library is suitable for:
* Encrypted communication to create applications similar to Telegram or Signal but with greater attention to computer security and privacy.
* Data transmission between device and cloud.
* Acquisition of telemetry data produced by equipment.
* Connecting the Internet of Things and wearable devices to the cloud.
* Protecting IoT devices from unauthorized access and attacks.
* Encrypting and protecting communications between IoT devices.
* Virtualize groups of devices, which interact with each other in an encrypted and independent manner.
* Making the communication network independent from static IPs
* Access devices that are protected by a firewall
* Assign digital identities to devices and accessories from the IoT
* Encrypted router for 5G technology
* And much more...

## The library works correctly under all kinds of circumstances and data lines, and is ready for production scenarios,

Our mission is to exacerbate the concept of security in messaging and create something conceptually new and innovative from a technical point of view. Top-level encrypted communication (there is no backend , there is no server-side contact list, there is no server but a simple router, the theory is that if the server does not exist then the server cannot be hacked, the communication is anonymous, the IDs are derived from a hash of the public keys, therefore in no case it is possible to trace who originates the messages, the encryption key is changed for each single message, and a system of digital signatures guarantees the origin of the messages and prevents attacks "men in the middle"). We use different concepts introduced with Bitcoin technology and the library itself: there are no accounts, the account is simply a pair of public and private keys, groups are also supported, the group ID is derived from a hash computed through the public keys of the members, since the hash process is irreversible, the level of anonymity is maximum). The publication of the source wants to demonstrate the genuineness of the concepts we have adopted! Thanks for your attention!
 
* [A robust cross-platform Cloud using this library as an underlying (Encrypted Clod)](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/CloudClient)

This project consists of three parts in the form of a library for security and functionality:

* [Secure storage](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/SecureStorage) it is a powerful data safe, the cryptographic keys and data that would allow the software to be attacked are kept with this tool.

* [Encrypted messaging](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging) it is a powerful low-level cryptographic protocol, of the Trustless type, which manages communication, groups and contacts (this software will never access your address book, this library is the heart of the application)

* [Communication channel](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging/tree/master/CommunicationChannel) is the low-level socket communication protocol underlying encrypted communication.

This project uses the Communication Channel project as its underlying, which creates a socket communication channel for transmitting and receiving encrypted data upstream from the library.
Communication Channel underlies the encrypted messaging protocol, we have separated the two parts because the idea is to provide an universal communication protocol, which can work on any type of communication medium and hardware. Communication Channel creates a tcp socket communication channel, but this underlying one can be replaced with an analogous communication channel working with GSM data networks (without using the internet), or with rs232, rs485 ports, or any other communication devices either digital and analog. Just change the underlying encrypted communication protocol and we can easily implement encrypted communication on any type of device and in any scenario. If necessary, we can create implementations of new communication channels on different hardware, on commission.

These libraries are also distributed as NuGet packages:

* [Secure storage (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SecureStorage/)

* [Encrypted messaging (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EncryptedMessaging/)

* [Communication channel (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunicationChannel/)
