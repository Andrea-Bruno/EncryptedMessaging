*(Secure Tactical Adaptive Next-Generation Protocol - Version 2 Proposal)*  

**EncryptedMessaging (STANG-V2 Candidate): A Versatile System for Secure Communications**

EncryptedMessaging (STANG-V2 Candidate) is an encrypted messaging platform designed to adapt to a wide range of operational scenarios, from industrial systems to advanced military applications. Its strength lies in its complete abstraction from the physical transmission medium, allowing it to operate seamlessly over wired networks, wireless connections, dedicated links, or even unconventional communication channels.

The system is structured around an innovative concept of independent domains, where each domain represents a separate communication circuit. This architecture allows for the simultaneous management of distinct environments—such as a test network, a main operations network, and various specialized domains—without interference between them, while sharing the same physical transmission infrastructure.

At the heart of the system is a robust framework for digital identity management. Each device is authenticated using a unique cryptographic key pair, ensuring that each message's origin and integrity can be verified through digital signatures. Communications never occur between "naked" devices, but always between certified identities, creating an ecosystem where the provenance of every piece of data is always verifiable.

The platform natively supports the creation of dynamic groups, where multiple identities can be aggregated into configurable contact lists. Each contact is essentially a reference to a public key, used to encrypt messages so that only the legitimate recipient can decrypt them. This structure allows for hierarchical and flexible communication, adapting to complex organizational structures.

A distinctive feature is the multicast message distribution approach. Instead of replicating transmissions for each recipient, the system encapsulates a single encrypted payload with ephemeral keys specific to each group member. This mechanism, combined with strict key rotation, ensures transmission efficiency and security against retroactive decryption attempts.

The infrastructure uses specialized routers designed according to the trustless principle, which act as intelligent buffers for messages in transit. These routing nodes, while not having access to encrypted content, ensure reliable packet delivery even when the recipient devices are not immediately reachable, maintaining operational continuity in scenarios with intermittent connectivity.

Practical applications range from remote control of industrial systems to drone fleet management, from secure telemetry of critical equipment to the creation of resilient command and control networks. In the military field, the system is particularly suited to operations requiring encrypted communications between special forces units, coordination of multiple assets in an operational theater, and the exchange of sensitive information in electronically hostile environments.

The ability to operate on heterogeneous transmission media, combined with the rigorous cryptographic protocols implemented, makes EncryptedMessaging a particularly suitable solution for organizations requiring a unified, secure communications system that can adapt to different operational scenarios without compromising data protection.

## The Future of Military Communication: Swarms, Strategy, and STANG-V2

Modern technological developments are transforming conventional attack strategies. Increasingly, it is understood that concentrated force is more effective when dispersed across coordinated swarms, rather than delivered through isolated points of attack—such as individual aircraft or ground units. Much like the way popular imagination portrays the lion as the strongest predator, in reality, the most efficient attack often comes from piranhas, whose small size is compensated by their lethal coordination in groups.

In future warfare, swarms of drones—low-cost, autonomous, and highly adaptive—will redefine tactical operations. Acting in synchronization, they will deliver impact comparable to that of piranhas confronting their prey: precise, overwhelming, and collectively intelligent.

However, existing military communication systems are not designed to manage dynamic group strategies. Most currently rely on shared decryption keys across entire fleets, enabling centralized broadcast messaging. This architecture presents critical vulnerabilities: the leakage of a single key from one compromised device could expose an entire operational plan to the enemy.

STANG-V2 introduces a groundbreaking alternative.

Unlike legacy protocols, STANG-V2 does not distribute common cryptographic keys across multiple devices. Instead, it uses ephemeral keys that change with each data packet, ensuring secure transmission and mitigating the risks of key compromise. This dynamic encryption framework positions STANG-V2 as a technologically superior protocol, tailored to meet the evolving demands of future military operations in both attack and defense scenarios.

Key advantages include:
- No shared keys among drone units
- Real-time key rotation per message
- High resistance to interception and retroactive decryption
- Full support for adaptive swarms and flexible tactical groupings

STANG-V2 is not just an encryption solution—it is a strategic evolution, ready to support the next generation of autonomous military systems.

### **Preamble: Redefining Secure Communications for Modern Warfare**  

In an era where quantum computing threatens legacy encryption and battlefield operations demand unprecedented coordination across distributed units, the **STANG-V2 candidate protocol** emerges as a transformative solution. This proposal presents a **quantum-resistant, multi-domain framework** designed to surpass existing NATO STANAG limitations while maintaining full interoperability with current systems.  

At its core, STANG-V2 introduces **Ephemeral Per-Message Key Encryption (EPMKE)** – a paradigm where each transmission is secured with a unique cryptographic key, dynamically generated and individually wrapped for every recipient using their public key. This approach, combined with **Group-Aware Key Distribution (GAKD)**, enables:  
- **Secure multicast communications** (e.g., simultaneous encrypted command dissemination to 100+ drones).  
- **Compartmentalized subgroup messaging** without key reuse vulnerabilities.  
- **Zero-trust metadata protection** through pseudonymous participant identifiers.  

Unlike traditional session-based encryption, STANG-V2’s **Key-Per-Message Architecture (KPMA)** ensures that even if a single key is compromised, only one message is affected – a critical advantage against advanced persistent threats.  

---

### **1. Introduction: Addressing the Gaps in Current Standards**  

Existing NATO STANAG protocols (e.g., 4406, 5066) face three critical challenges in modern combat environments:  
1. **Quantum Vulnerability**: Reliance on ECDSA/RSA exposes communications to future Shor’s algorithm attacks.  
2. **Infrastructure Dependence**: Centralized servers create single points of failure.  
3. **Operational Rigidity**: IP-bound designs limit adaptability in EW-denied environments.  

The STANG-V2 candidate protocol addresses these limitations through:  

#### **1.1 Post-Quantum Hybrid Cryptography**  
- **Double-Layer Signatures**: ECDSA-521 + NTRU L5 signatures provide both NATO compliance (NSA Suite B) and quantum resistance.  
- **AES-256/GCM** for bulk encryption with **Key Derivation Ratcheting** – each message’s key is derived from the previous one but cannot be reversed.  

#### **1.2 Serverless Group Communications**  
- **Multi-Recipient Key Wrapping (MRKW)**: A single message payload is encrypted with:  
  ```math  
  E_{msg} = [E_{K_1}(AES_{key}), E_{K_2}(AES_{key}), ..., E_{K_n}(AES_{key})] + AES_{key}(Payload)  
  ```  
  Where \(K_1...K_n\) are recipients’ public keys.  
- **Dynamic Subgrouping**: Tactical units can be reorganized ad-hoc without rekeying (e.g., separating drone swarms into reconnaissance/attack clusters).

### **2. Technical Architecture**  

#### **2.1 Cryptographic Foundations**  
| Component               | STANG-V2 Candidate Solution         | NATO STANAG Equivalent |  
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|  
| **Encryption**          | AES-256-GCM + NTRU KEM              | AES-256 (STANAG 4546)  |  
| **Authentication**      | ECDSA-521 + NTRU Sign               | ECDSA (NSA Suite B)    |  
| **Key Distribution**    | MLS-inspired Key Packages           | Manual key rotation    |  

#### **2.2 Transport Layer Agnosticism**  
STANG-V2 operates over:  
- **Traditional IP networks** (backward-compatible with STANAG 5066).  
- **Non-IP channels** (tactical radios, laser comms, acoustic links).  
- **Disruption-tolerant networks** (store-and-forward via secure relays).  

**Case Study**: A submarine could receive encrypted orders via sonar, retransmit them to drones via LoRa, and confirm execution through a satellite laser link – all using the same cryptographic envelope.  

---

### **3. Operational Advantages Over Legacy Systems**  

#### **3.1 Tactical Flexibility**  
- **Mission-Specific Key Hierarchies**:  
  ```python  
  # Example: Drone swarm command structure  
  group_key = derive_key("Recon-Alpha", master_key)  
  subgroup_keys = [derive_key(f"Unit-{i}", group_key) for i in range(10)]  
  ```  
- **1:N Secure Messaging**: 50% bandwidth reduction compared to STANAG 4406 multicast.  

#### **3.2 Security Enhancements**  
- **Forward Secrecy++**: Keys are not just ephemeral but also **unlinkable** between messages.  
- **Signature Chaining**: Each message includes a hash of the previous one to prevent timeline manipulation.  

---

### **4. NATO Integration Pathway**  

#### **4.1 Compliance Strategy**  
- **Phase 1 (Validation)**:  
  - Certify NTRU L5 under **STANAG 4778 Annex Q**.  
  - Test interoperability with **Harris Falcon IV** radios.  
- **Phase 2 (Adoption)**:  
  - Integrate into **Federated Mission Networking (FMN)**.  
  - Develop **Tactical Reference Implementation** for NATO CIS.  

#### **4.2 Backward Compatibility**  
STANG-V2 supports:  
- **Legacy Mode**: AES-256-only for older systems.  
- **Transitional Mode**: Hybrid ECDSA+NTRU signatures.

## EncryptedMessaging vs Signal: A Paradigm Shift in Secure Communication

EncryptedMessaging is a project born with a clear mission: to provide a secure, flexible, and adaptable communication platform that breaks free from the constraints of conventional messaging systems. Unlike Signal—which established itself as a solution for private, internet-based conversations—EncryptedMessaging was not designed as a messaging app, but rather as a universal cryptographic layer. This design choice immediately sets it apart from the libsignal-protocol library, which is tightly coupled with client-server architecture and the TCP/IP data transmission model.

EncryptedMessaging’s core strength lies in its complete independence from any specific physical transmission medium. While Signal requires active internet connectivity and relies on centralized servers for identity management and key exchange, EncryptedMessaging functions just as well on GSM networks without IP, serial ports like RS232 and RS485, modulated optical channels (e.g. laser or LED), analog radio, NFC, LoRa, Bluetooth, and even decentralized mesh systems. This media-agnostic capability makes it ideal for scenarios where infrastructure may be limited, latency must be minimized, or communications must be isolated from public networks for security reasons. Use cases range from military systems and embedded devices, to industrial networks, autonomous robotics, medical applications, and real-time telemetry acquisition.

When it comes to security architecture, the contrast between the two platforms becomes even clearer. Signal relies on a central server for user registration, message routing, and key management—each account tied to a phone number, creating a centralized point of vulnerability. Though encrypted, Signal’s infrastructure stores metadata and user associations, making it susceptible to data breaches, outages, or government access requests.

EncryptedMessaging eliminates this risk by adopting a completely serverless model. There are no backend servers, no databases, and no enforced user identifiers. Each participant in the network owns a cryptographic identity based on public/private keys, and every transmitted packet is digitally signed by the sender. This guarantees the integrity and origin of data without relying on third parties. The system is trustless by design: messages are simply propagated through routers or proxies that act as stateless repeaters, unable to decrypt, analyze, or retain any sensitive information. Because the infrastructure does not exist in the traditional sense, it cannot be compromised.

Another unique feature of EncryptedMessaging is its ability to serve as a foundational security layer beneath existing communication protocols. It can be integrated transparently within any data stack—from HTTP to Modbus, from MQTT to CAN bus—without altering protocol logic. This allows legacy systems or specialized industrial applications to benefit from high-grade encryption without reengineering their core communication workflows.

EncryptedMessaging is not only practical—it’s technically robust. Built with cryptographic algorithms such as AES-256 and SHA-256, and compatible with NATO standards like STANAG 4774/4778, the library delivers military-grade security. Every message is signed and independently verifiable, offering a level of accountability and resilience not present in Signal’s architecture. Its decentralized, trustless structure ensures that sensitive communication is not just secure in transit, but shielded from systemic vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, EncryptedMessaging is not simply an alternative to Signal—it’s a paradigm shift in secure communication design. It transcends the boundaries of messaging apps, enabling cryptographic protection wherever data is transmitted. Its flexibility, independence from centralized infrastructure, compatibility with non-IP media, and architectural resilience make it an ideal candidate for mission-critical environments. From defense and IoT to industrial automation and real-time control systems, EncryptedMessaging redefines how security can—and should—be implemented.

## The library works correctly under all kinds of circumstances and data lines, and is ready for production scenarios,

Our mission is to exacerbate the concept of security in messaging and create something conceptually new and innovative from a technical point of view. Top-level encrypted communication (there is no backend , there is no server-side contact list, there is no server but a simple router, the theory is that if the server does not exist then the server cannot be hacked, the communication is anonymous, the IDs are derived from a hash of the public keys, therefore in no case it is possible to trace who originates the messages, the encryption key is changed for each single message, and a system of digital signatures guarantees the origin of the messages and prevents attacks "men in the middle"). We use different concepts introduced with Bitcoin technology and the library itself: there are no accounts, the account is simply a pair of public and private keys, groups are also supported, the group ID is derived from a hash computed through the public keys of the members, since the hash process is irreversible, the level of anonymity is maximum). The publication of the source wants to demonstrate the genuineness of the concepts we have adopted! Thanks for your attention!

This open source project on GitHub is a tutorial for using and implementing this library in a real use case:

* [Powerful messaging software using this library](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/AnonymousMessenger)

* [A robust cross-platform Cloud using this library as an underlying (Encrypted Clod)](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/CloudClient)

This project consists of three parts in the form of a library for security and functionality:

* [Secure storage](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/SecureStorage) it is a powerful data safe, the cryptographic keys and data that would allow the software to be attacked are kept with this tool.

* [Encrypted messaging](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging) it is a powerful low-level cryptographic protocol, of the Trustless type, which manages communication, groups and contacts (this software will never access your address book, this library is the heart of the application)

* [Communication channel](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging/tree/master/CommunicationChannel) is the low-level socket communication protocol underlying encrypted communication.

This project uses the Communication Channel project as its underlying, which creates a socket communication channel for transmitting and receiving encrypted data upstream from the library.
Communication Channel underlies the encrypted messaging protocol, we have separated the two parts because the idea is to provide an universal communication protocol, which can work on any type of communication medium and hardware. Communication Channel creates a tcp socket communication channel, but this underlying one can be replaced with an analogous communication channel working with GSM data networks (without using the internet), or with rs232, rs485 ports, or any other communication devices either digital and analog. Just change the underlying encrypted communication protocol and we can easily implement encrypted communication on any type of device and in any scenario. If necessary, we can create implementations of new communication channels on different hardware, on commission.

These libraries are also distributed as NuGet packages:
