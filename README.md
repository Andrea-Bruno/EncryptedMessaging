## Key Features

- **Transparent Encryption**  
  The encryption layer operates seamlessly, ensuring that the integration process does not disrupt the functionality of existing systems. This makes the implementation of EncryptedMessaging painless and efficient.

- **Compatibility with Existing Protocols**  
  EncryptedMessaging supports the use of standardized or proprietary command sets, enabling secure communication without requiring changes to the protocol structure or logic.

- **Military-Grade Security**  
  The solution meets the requirements for military certification, ensuring the protection of sensitive data even in hostile environments. It provides robust measures to safeguard confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

- **Seamless Integration**  
  Organizations can adopt EncryptedMessaging without the need for extensive re-engineering, making it suitable for both legacy systems and modern architectures.

## Architecture

EncryptedMessaging operates as an additional layer within the communication stack, ensuring that the data is encrypted transparently while preserving the original protocol's capabilities.

### Layers of Operation

1. **Protocol Layer**  
   The existing protocol generates the data (e.g., commands for devices or equipment). EncryptedMessaging does not alter the protocol's structure or operations.

2. **Encryption Layer**  
   The data is encrypted transparently before transmission, ensuring security without requiring modifications to the original protocol.

3. **Decryption Layer**  
   On the receiving end, the data is decrypted and passed to the protocol layer for further processing.

### Workflow

The following workflow illustrates how EncryptedMessaging ensures secure data transmission:

1. The protocol generates data to be transmitted (e.g., commands or operational information for devices).
2. EncryptedMessaging encrypts the data transparently.
3. The encrypted data is transmitted securely to the recipient.
4. The recipient decrypts the data using EncryptedMessaging, making it available for processing by the original protocol.

## Advantages

- **Ease of Integration**  
  EncryptedMessaging integrates seamlessly with existing systems, reducing the time and cost of implementation.

- **Enhanced Security**  
  Sensitive data and operational commands are protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

- **Support for Proprietary Command Sets**  
  Organizations can maintain their proprietary command sets without re-engineering, ensuring continuity and efficiency.

- **Reliability in Operational Contexts**  
  By ensuring secure and reliable communication, EncryptedMessaging enhances operational effectiveness in critical scenarios.

## The library works correctly under all kinds of circumstances and data lines, and is ready for production scenarios,

Our mission is to exacerbate the concept of security in messaging and create something conceptually new and innovative from a technical point of view. Top-level encrypted communication (there is no backend , there is no server-side contact list, there is no server but a simple router, the theory is that if the server does not exist then the server cannot be hacked, the communication is anonymous, the IDs are derived from a hash of the public keys, therefore in no case it is possible to trace who originates the messages, the encryption key is changed for each single message, and a system of digital signatures guarantees the origin of the messages and prevents attacks "men in the middle"). We use different concepts introduced with Bitcoin technology and the library itself: there are no accounts, the account is simply a pair of public and private keys, groups are also supported, the group ID is derived from a hash computed through the public keys of the members, since the hash process is irreversible, the level of anonymity is maximum). The publication of the source wants to demonstrate the genuineness of the concepts we have adopted! Thanks for your attention!

This open source project on GitHub is a tutorial for using and implementing this library in a real use case:

* [Powerful messaging software using this library](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/AnonymousMessenger)

* [A robust cross-platform Cloud using this library as an underlying (Encrypted Clod)](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/CloudClient)

This project consists of three parts in the form of a library for security and functionality:

* [Secure storage](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/SecureStorage) it is a powerful data safe, the cryptographic keys and data that would allow the software to be attacked are kept with this tool.

* [Encrypted messaging](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging) it is a powerful low-level cryptographic protocol, of the Trustless type, which manages communication, groups and contacts (this software will never access your address book, this library is the heart of the application)

* [Communication channel](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging/tree/master/CommunicationChannel) is the low-level socket communication protocol underlying encrypted communication.

This project uses the Communication Channel project as its underlying, which creates a socket communication channel for transmitting and receiving encrypted data upstream from the library.
Communication Channel underlies the encrypted messaging protocol, we have separated the two parts because the idea is to provide an universal communication protocol, which can work on any type of communication medium and hardware. Communication Channel creates a tcp socket communication channel, but this underlying one can be replaced with an analogous communication channel working with GSM data networks (without using the internet), or with rs232, rs485 ports, or any other communication devices either digital and analog. Just change the underlying encrypted communication protocol and we can easily implement encrypted communication on any type of device and in any scenario. If necessary, we can create implementations of new communication channels on different hardware, on commission.

These libraries are also distributed as NuGet packages:
